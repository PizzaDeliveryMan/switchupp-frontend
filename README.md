# Switchupp Front End - Made with Quasar Framework

> This is a fork of a University project.

> Since this was made pre-0.15, ```quasar-cli@0.6.5``` is added as one of the node modules. Use [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) to run ```quasar``` from your local modules.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
$ npx quasar dev

# build for production with minification
$ npx quasar build

# lint code
$ npx quasar lint
```
