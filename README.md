# Switchupp Front End - Made with Quasar Framework

> This is a fork of a University project. I think the goal was to make something social yet niche so most of us in the group were uninterested in the topic, settling on the idea of reporting incidents of infrastructure flaws around the city since that was 'approved'. This is the front end of this debacle.

> Since this was made pre-0.15, ```quasar-cli@0.6.5``` is added as one of the node modules. Use [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) to run ```quasar``` from your local modules.

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
$ npx quasar dev

# build for production with minification
