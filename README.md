Have a read of Vue.js here: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/
and the framework we're using: http://quasar-framework.org/guide/

Before starting out in Vue.js, I suggest reading the basics from their
easy-to-follow documentation for a while or try these posts on Medium
to get a feel of setting up a Vue.js project since they do teach you
how to structure a Vue.js project:

(For 2nd link, the way he set up the directories will differ to what we will be
using so just take note of that)

After looking those up, come back to read the rest below to find out
some standards/quirks of this particular project:

1) Since we're using ESLint, in our Vue Components, our indentation needs
to be 2 spaces to follow Javascript's standard. This could be changed in
the .eslintrc.js file but I decided against it since it's a standard and
it'll be good to follow for future projects we might undertake requiring
Javascript

2) Local image binding in Vue.js is weird. If I place my images under
the assets directory, there is no way for me to bind them...only option is to write out the full image path.
Current way I found out is to place the images in /src/statics. That will work for local images.
E.g.

``` html
<template>
  <div>
    <img :src="IMGPATH"> <!-- or -->
    <img v-bind:src"IMGPATH"> <!-- for the binding -->
    <!-- : is the shorter form for v-bind in this case -->
  <div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'test',
  data () {
    return {
      IMGPATH: './statics/rowlet.jpg'
    }
  }
}
</script>
```
